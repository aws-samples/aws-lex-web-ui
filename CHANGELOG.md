## [0.21.0] - 2024-03-01
- Upgraded the existing solution and relevant dependencies to Vue 3. Migrating from Vuetify 1.5 -> 3 in the process, skipping over Vuetify 2 entirely, requiring clean-up and reconfiguration of all UI components. Goal was to get parity in UI from the previous release, which includes some new CSS rules to maintain the look at feel of the previous UI. These changes could result in **breaking changes** to custom CSS despite efforts to maintain backwards compatibilty many Vuetify classes changed names during the upgrade. Please use caution when updating to this version of the Lex Web UI UI.

## [0.20.6] - 2024-02-12
- Emergency fix to upgrade Python function to version 3.8 across the board. As this will end of life later in the year we will release another update soon to move everything to 3.12.

- Clean-up & fix issues related to webpack 5 and `npm run` related errors for some build types.

## [0.20.3] - 2023-12-7
- Add streaming support. Refer to Streaming Responses README for full details.
- Fixed bug where CSS was not being properly applied to minimized button color.

## [0.20.2] - 2023-11-28

- Dependency upgrades to fix critical vulnerabilities.

## [0.20.1] - 2023-10-24
- Removed breaking change of adding CSP configurations into Cloudfront. CSP will remain in place on index.html file but Cloudfront CSPs will need to be manually configured. As a result removed MarkdownSupportDomains parameter.
- Minor bug fixes.
- Dependency upgrades to fix critical vulnerabilities.

## [0.20.0] - 2023-09-28
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed all inline scripts and added a CSP header to the index.html as well as CSP configurations to CloudFront. If your bot uses Markdown please not you will need to allow list all domains serving image/video using the MarkdownSupportDomains parameter (parent origin is automatically added to the CSP so no action is required in this case). Existing bots updating to this version & using Markdown **will break** if appropriate domains are not supplied.
- CSS adjustments can now be made directly in the CloudFormation template for some common use cases. If left blank
- Major updates to dependencies and webpack build processes for both the loader & web ui projects.
This update removes all dependency vulnerabilities as of release date.
- Dependencies used by the loader have been internalized to remove calls to external CDNs
- Cognito self-registration is now domain limited. If you want self-registration on you must provide a list of valid domains otherwise self-registration is turned off on the Cognito instance.
- Lowered the default timeout for Connect connections to 60 minutes.

## [0.19.9] - 2023-05-22
- Add configurable parameter to control delay between transcript message send on startup to Connect. Workaround Connect problem with respect to out of order delivery of sent messages.
- Add the ability to configure a precreated CNAME, ACM Certificate, and WAFV2 ACL via template parameters. If the values are left empty default CloudFront distribution url and certificates is used. If a WAFV2 ACl is not supplied then no WAF Acl is configured for use by CloudFront.

## [0.19.8] - 2023-04-15
- Update CloudFormation template to remove ACL on S3 server access logs bucket and replaced with a bucket policy to align with best practices. This will also prevent the template from failing when the default settings for S3 buckets are changed in the near future.
- Fixed issue where multilingual bots were not properly rendering the TimePicker interactive message component

## [0.19.7] - 2023-03-27
- Update to not allow V1 and V2 bots to be selected in CloudFormation parameters 
- Disable initial utterance sending if chat window is minimized on load

## [0.19.6] - 2022-10-17
- Fix issue where some empty string variables would break the Code Deploy build, for example, if InitialText was cleared out of the CloudFormation parameters.
- Added more CloudFormation parameters for commonly used UI properties. The new variables include:
    * HideButtonMessageBubble
    * MessageMenu
    * BackButton
    * MinimizedButtonContent
- Change initial speech mechanism to fetch and play mp3 files created during codebuild. Implement support for configured localeIds when creating the mp3 files. Create an mp3 for each configured localeId and use aws translate to generate text for the locale and use aws polly to create the mp3 files. When the user changes locale in the UI and clicks on the mic button, the initial speech for the selected locale will be played.
- Add support for Connect interactive messaging into Lex Web UI: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/interactive-messages.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/interactive-messages.html). Both ListPicker and TimePicker are supported templateTypes and can be sent using the exact same JSON structure as Connect.

In addition, the last message from the bot can be re-displayed after the help message giving the user context on next action again
- Prefer Lex V1 response cards over Lex V2 in the case where both are present. In a QnABot result, both a V1 and V2 response card will be present. V1 response cards might contain additional buttons not present in the V2 response card. When both are present, prefer the V1 response card.

      so messages are prepended with ( `bot says: `/ `I say: `)  helping to
      give context to visually impaired
    - Hide message date from screen readers
    - Hide loading message from screen readers
    - Hide avatar image from screen readers
    - Make the chatbot titlebar title a \<h1> heading – (Pages must contain
      a level-one heading)

    custom styles to it.
  - Add new config option `ui.shouldDisableClickedResponseCardButtons` to
    control whether response card buttons should be disabled after being clicked

## [0.12.0] - 2018-01-12
This release brings significant improvements which include various
breaking changes (see items with the **[BREAKING]** label). It overhauls
the following areas:
1. The loader script has been integrated into a single library. This
makes it easier to load the chatbot UI component since now there's only
one JavaScript file and a unified configuration
2. CloudFormation master template has been split into two different
templates based on the deployment mode (CodeBuild or Pipeline). This
simplifies the templates and their parameters
3. The chatbot UI messages are now encapsulated in a custom component
instead of a chip. The messages now display a date when clicked and can
show a bot avatar image next to the bot messages. More importantly, the
new message component will makes it easier in the future to extend the
content displayed in messages (e.g. adding html/markup rendering)

### Changed
- **[BREAKING]** Merged fullpage and iframe loader functionality
into a library that loads from a single script. If you were using
including the `chatbot-ui-*loader.js` scripts, you should change it to
`lex-web-ui-loader.js`. This new library uses a constructor to create
a loader object. The loader object must explicitly call its `load()`
function to load the component. For details, see the README under the
`src/lex-web-ui-loader` directory and the html files under `src/website`.
[0892314ef516ae31a7c0bb6d43369b9a9d1108e5]
- **[BREAKING]** Changed loader config to use a unified file for both the
iframe and full page loader. The new default configuration file name is:
`lex-web-ui-loader-config.json`. See a sample under the `src/config/`
directory. [dbcac4cc241b94e8669843b19fcd082f94b7cc84]
- Changed loader to allow keeping parent origin in config when
embedded [245ac70e647464e6abca01edd511d2b6963014be] - Changed
loader build environment to be based on webpack. This includes
integration with babel, eslint, post-css and webpack-dev-server
[8f1b7ac44c80e85811196930489931d1ea05704e]
- Changed message bubble from vuetify chips to a custom component. This
was done to allow greater flexibility in the style and structure of the
message bubbles and in preparation to render a more complex message format
[67192a0792c2d7433b24dda3b311d419e000b871]
- Changed vertical overflow in non-mobile devices to allow scrolling. This
enables mobile browsers to go full-screen when scrolling
[3b8efc9c8c9f3e838624cfe15e6249cf37db6bf4]
- Changed height calculation of toolbar, inputbar and message list to
make it more deterministic across browsers
[8b9132d17312468292893198061ed79fd7d89543]
- Bumped dependency versions [48aa6ace3e89554de6dcc49c81286b5770606715,

## [0.11.0] - 2017-11-13
### Changed
- Various changes to support IE11 in text mode (no voice). IE11 support
requires babel-polyfil to be loaded
- [BREAKING] Renamed bot-config.json file to chatbot-ui-loader.json
to be consistent with the iframe loader and new chatbot loader script
- Moved CloudFormation bootstrap bucket configuration from a map to a
parameter to make it easier to deploy from different sources without
modifying the template
- Changed the parent page setup when using the CreatePipeline deployment
from the CloudFormation templates. It now uses the same page, iframe
loader and configuration as the pre-built deployment. The parent page is
also mounted under /static/iframe/parent.html when running the localhost
dev server (i.e. npm run dev under the lex-web-ui dir)
- Improved dist Makefile to only build the library when there are
changes to the component. Additionally added support to build the new
chatbot loader

### Added
- Added a chatbot loader script that can be used to load dependencies
and config. The loader simplifies the creation of a full page chatbot
site by removing the need to manually add the dependencies and config
- Added CloudFormation parameters to support setting basic chatbot
UI configuration including toolbar title and initial messages. These
parameters are used when deploying the pre-built library from the dist
directory (default)
- Added an allow="microphone" attribute to the iframe tag created by the
iframe loader script. This was done to avoid issues with cross-origin
iframes in newer versions of Chrome

### Removed
- Removed webrtc-adapter dependency from the recorder component
- Removed the deprecated parent page under lex-web-ui/static/iframe. The
parent page in src/website is now copied dynamically during build time

### Fixed
- Fixed issue causing iframeOrigin to be overwritten by event in
sample parent.html. The iframe loader now defaults the iframeOrigin to
window.location.origin only if it is not found in the config.

## [0.10.0] - 2017-10-27
### Changed
- Detailed errors are no longer shown in bot response messages by default.
This is controlled by the `ui.showErrorDetails` config field which
defaults to false.
- Changed display of minimized message list to hide using use v-show
instead of v-if to maintain scroll position
- Changed components to be more compatible with latest vuetify version
- Changed tooltips to work with the latest vuetify and to clear on mobile
- Changed playback progress indicator to have smoother updates
- Clarified main readme including more HTML integration examples
- Changed viewport of index.html to prevent scaling issues
- Iframe loader script in the dist directory is now transpiled using babel
to improve browser compatibility
- Iframe loader css in the dist directory is now post-processed using
autoprefixer to improve browser compatibility
- Updated dependencies

### Added
- Added the ability to emit a vue event when the lex state changes.
This event can be handled with v-on when using the library as a Vue
component.
- Added a new config field: `ui.showErrorDetails` that can be set to true
to display detailed errors in bot response messages. When set to false
(default), only generic error messages are displayed in bot responses.
- Ability to pass a configuration object to the iframe loader during
initialization
- Added recorder options in default store config to make testing consistent

### Fixed
- Fixed a promise return issue when posting a text message
- Fixed audio playback ended index issue
- Fixed recording and playback interruption issue

### Removed
- Removed unused styles

## [0.9.1] - 2017-08-20
This release refactors the LexWeb component to make it easier to test
and include it in other applications/sites. The input toolbar is now more
compact and provides better visual feedback. It adds a send button to the
text input and a progress bar to better indicate processing and playback
status. This release also provides bug fixes and improved unit testing.

### Changed
- LexWeb component is now wrapped in a vuetify v-app component to avoid
having to use the vuetify v-app outside of it. The LexWeb component now
sets a min height that is dynamcally calculated based on the input bar
height. When minimized, all subcomponents are hidden with the exception
of the top toolbar.
- Input bar on the bottom of the chatbot UI is now wrapped in a vuetify
toolbar component. The container now has a fixed height which makes it
easier to calculate offsets
- The StatusBar component was renamed to RecorderStatus as that is a more
appropriate name. It is now loaded from the the InputContainer component
instead of directly from the LexWeb component
- Renamed bot-loader.\* files to chatbot-ui-iframe-loader.\* to better
reflect the use case
- Bump dependency versions

### Added
- Added a send button to the input container. This button is shown
when typing a message or when the mic is disabled
- Added an a linear progress bar when the bot audio is playing
- Added an indeterminate linear progress bar when the recorder is
processing
- Added title attribute to iframe in bot-loader.js script to improve
accessibility
- Added config options to chatbot-ui-iframe-loader.js to better control
the loading of the config and dependencies:
    * `shouldLoadConfigFromJsonFile`: controls if the script loads config
    from a JSON File
    * `shouldLoadConfigFromEvent`: controls if the script loads config
    from an event
    * `shouldAddAwsSdk`: controls if the AWS SDK is automatically added
- Added unit tests for InputContainer and RecorderStatus components
- Added getAudioProperties store action
- Added README.md under src/website. For now, this readme
is pretty much the same as the iframe embedding readme under
lex-web-ui/static/iframe. This is in preparation to deprecate the parent
page under lex-web-ui

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug affecting the enable config option of the recorder
- Fixed creds refresh issue when running in an iframe.
- Fixed an issue with space trimming in text input
- Fixed iframe height issue in MS Edge
- Fixed audio initialization that caused problems in unit tests

## [0.9.0] - 2017-08-04
This release adds a couple of simplified deployment options:
1. Simplfied CloudFormation stack without a deployment pipeline.
It uses CodeBuild to create the config files and to deploy directly
to S3.
This mode is the new default of the CloudFormation setup so if
you want to keep using the deployment pipeline setup (CodeCommit,
CodeBuild, CodePipeline), you are going to need to explicitly set the
`CreatePipeline` parameter to true.
2. AWS Mobile Hub project file that deploys the Web UI to S3 fronted
by a CloudFront distribution. The Mobile Hub project also creates the
Cognito Identity Pool, Lex Bot and IAM Roles. This allows to deploy the
application from a single file hosted in github.

**NOTE**: At this point, there is a Content-Type issue with the files
deployed using the Mobile Hub project file. The Mobile Hub deployed
files seem to have its content-type set to octect-stream which causes the
browser to download the files instead of rendering. To work around this
issue, you can re-upload the files using the S3 console or aws cli. The
Makefile in the root dir can be used to upload the files with the right
content type. Use the command: `make sync-website` (requires setting
the bucket name with the `WEBAPP_BUCKET` environmental variable). This
issue will be further investigated.

### Added
- Added Mobile Hub deployment
- Added new CloudFormation template `codebuild.yaml` used to deploy the
application without a pipeline
- Added `CreatePipeline` parameter to the master.yaml template to control
whether the stack should create a deployment pipeline
- Added build-time support to set web UI config fields that are commonly
changed using environmental variables. This is in preparation to set
these variables from CloudFormation parameters. The new variables include:
    * BOT_INITIAL_TEXT
    * BOT_INITIAL_SPEECH
    * UI_TOOLBAR_TITLE
    * UI_TOOLBAR_LOGO
- Added a new `config` directory in the root of the repo that includes
build configuration
- Added a new `src` directory in the root of the repo to hold the
website files. This includes a modified version of the iframe parent
page and bot-loader that resides in the `lex-web-ui/static/iframe`
directory. Eventualy, this new version should replace, somehow get
merged with the other, or sourced in both places from a single file.
- Added a `server.js` file for quick development and testing. It loads
the sample page from the dist and source directories. It can be used
with the command `npm start` from the root directory. You may need to put
the right values in the config files under `src/config` to make it work.
- Added CloudFormation format statement to all templates files
- Added .npmignore file
- Added sample code on how to use the Vue plugin for including the
component into an existing Vue application

### Changed
- **[BREAKING]** CloudFormation setup now defaults to not creating a
development pipeline and just copy the prebuilt files to an S3 bucket.
To use the pipeline, you now have to set the `CreatePipeline` parameter
to true
- Refactored the build scripts and Makefiles to have better separation
of config and code. The config config used by the Makefiles now resides
under: `config/env.mk`. Some of the names of the Makefile have changed so
you may need to change your environment if you were using the Makefiles
from other script.
- The `update-lex-web-ui-config.js` build script now takes its config from
a node js module in the `config` directory. The config is driven by the
`BUILD_TYPE` environmental variable which controls whether the deployment
is building the app from full source or using the dist dir. For this, the
value of the `BUILD_TYPE` variable can be set to either `full` or `dist`.
- Updated CodeBuild environment to node js v6.3.1 using ubuntu
- Renamed iframe bot.css to bot-loader.css
- Updated dependency versions
- Clarified READMEs

## [0.8.3] - 2017-07-29

## [0.8.0] - 2017-07-24
This release makes it easier to include the chatbot UI into existing
sites. The project now distributes a pre-built library in the dist
directory. This allows to use the chatbot UI without having to build the
application. The root directory of the repo now contains a package.json
file to make it easier to npm install it.

There are a few breaking changes regarding the supported URL parameters
which now use the `lexWebUi` prefix to avoid conflicts when including
the component in an existing site.

### Changed
- **[BREAKING]** Changed config passing URL query parameter from `config`
  to `lexWebUiConfig`
- **[BREAKING]** Changed URL query parameter to run in embedded mode from
  `embed` to `lexWebUiEmbed`
- The `parentOrigin` config variable now defaults to
  `window.location.origin` to support single origin iframe setups
  without having to set it in the the JSON config file
- Restructured Vuex store including:
    * Split state, mutations and actions to individual files
    * Moved audio, recorder, aws credentials/clients out of the state.
      Those now exist as module variables visible from the store actions
    * AWS credentials from parent are now manually recreated to avoid
      including the AWS SDK as part of the store
- Changed from using vuex mapGetter in components to instead use the
  store state variables. This was done to avoid redistributing vuex
  in the built library and to support vuex being loaded outside of the
  chatbot ui.
- Moved Vue component initialization from LexApp.vue to LexWeb.vue
- Moved Page component to LexApp.vue from LexWeb.vue
- Moved webpack related import config from recorder to the general
  webpack config
- Commented out webrtc-adapter import in preparation to deprecating it
- Changed constructor arguments of lex client to accept a
  lexRuntime client instead of AWS credentials or SDK config. This allows
  redistributing without having to include AWS SDK as a direct dependency
- Changed iframe container class name
- Rearranged the README files. The main README contains info about the
  npm package and instructions to use the library. The CloudFormation and
  application details where move to different README files.

### Added
- Created a Vue plugin that can be used to instantiate the chatbot ui
  both as an import in a webpack based project or by directly sourcing
  the library in a script tag. The plugin registers itself and adds
  a property named `$lexWebUi` to the Vue class. It adds a global Vue
  component name `LexWebUi`
- Added a distribution build config and related scripts
- Added an example on how to encode the URL query parameter config
- Added a new config object key `urlQueryParams` holding the url query
  parameters

## [0.7.1] - 2017-07-17
This release adds basic unit and e2e testing. Various components were
refactored to enable this.

### Changed
- Synched vue build environment with latest vue cli template
- Refactored store to make it more modular and easier to test including:
  * It no longer exports a Vuex object but instead exports an object that
    can be used as a vuex constructor argument
  * It no longer uses the global AWS object. It now creates its own AWS
    Config object
  * It no longer creates the bot audio element. The Audio element is set
    with an action
- Moved Vuex store instantiation to the LexApp component
- Refactored the lex run time client library to accept an AWS SDK Config
  object to avoid using the global one

### Added
- Added setup for running e2e test including:
  * Added nightwatch chrome options to fake devices for mocking mic
  * Changed nightwatch runner to connect dev server if already running
  * Basic e2e test for stand-alone and iframe
